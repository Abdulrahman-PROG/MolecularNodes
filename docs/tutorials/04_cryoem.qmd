title: CryoEM Maps

We can import CryoEM maps, which are imported into Blender as a 'volume' object. As Blender is designed to work with data for movies and TV shows, this is implemented in a way to emulate smoke or gas. We aren't looking to annimate these volumes, but when we import the volume we can create a surface based on a cutoff for the density, the same as you do with ChimeraX.
